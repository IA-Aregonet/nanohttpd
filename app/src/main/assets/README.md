OakSim uses the assembler framework [Keystone](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone) and the CPU emulator framework [Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) which are both licensed under the GPLv2 license. These frameworks have been ported into a Javascript API [Unicorn.js](https://github.com/AlexAltea/unicorn.js) and [Keystone.js](https://github.com/AlexAltea/keystone.js) via Emscripten by [AlexAltea](https://github.com/AlexAltea).
